# Brand-Kit

## Welcome to the Linagee Name Registrar (LNR) Brand Kit!

```All designs available in this public GitHub Repository are open-source and free-to-use.```

### Typeface: 
[Lato Family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato/) (Free-to-Use)
> Lato is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” in Polish). In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.

In the LNR Full Logotype, the word *Linagee* uses Lato (Bold) and the words *Name Registrar* use Lato (Light) to create an emphasis on the name Linagee.

### Color Palette:

* Blue: `#69dfff` or `rgb(105,223,255)`
* Purple: `#bc8dff` or `rgb(188,141,255)`

### Application

The scalable vector graphic **(.svg) files should be used as much as possible**, so there is no loss of resolution.
